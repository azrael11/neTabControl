# neTabControl
neTabControl is a FireMonkey control for Delphi. It builds on the native TabControl and adds a number of features.

> **Important note:** Starting from v.1.0.0, neTabControl is not a simple subclass of TTabControl as in previous versions. If you use previous versions you need to update the control in the forms you're using it

#Video Demonstration
Follow this link for a quick demo: [neTabControl Video](https://youtu.be/1OxMN-HeWhk "neTabControl Video")


# Design
The control uses three elements:

1. A Tag
2. A TneTabItem: A subclass of TTabItem
3. A Frame

The neTabControl holds several TabItems, which all inherit from TneTabItem and shows a TFrame for each TneTabItem.

For more details about the Architecture of neTabControl, check the wiki.


# How To Use

Build and install the package: Open the Package file and install the component. Then you can drag and drop it in any forms

**Note:** The actual components of each tab need to be embedded in a Frame and then attached to the tabControl


# FMX Style
Starting from version 1.0.0 neTabControl doesn't use styles to embed the close image.


# Highlights

* Tab items are linked to tags instead of indices. 
For example you can write: SetActiveTab("Welcome Screen") or DeleteTab('Report Summary')
* TabItems have close icon
* TabItems can embed any control that descends from TControl (eg, image, progress bar, etc.) [v.1.0.0]
* Ability to add controls before or after the tab items (eg. Add button, etc.) [v.1.0.0]
* Style-indenendent tab item control. You can use any pre-existing style file without any customisation. neTabControl embeds the close image and the other control automatically [v.1.0.0]
* Customisable Pop-up menu
* Procedure to export the list of open tabs in order to implement load/save workspace feature
